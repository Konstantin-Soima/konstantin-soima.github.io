On May 16, the Russians of Wrocław “Buried evil and tyranny” on the Main Square.
The funeral processionbrought a coffin with a tyrant doll and wreaths with ribbons to the "bloody tyrant, murderer, executioner and madman" from all the victims of Putin's war in Ukraine and prisoners of the totalitarian regime.
Passers-by wrote notes to the tyrant and lit candles in memory of those who had died at the hands of the occupiers.
